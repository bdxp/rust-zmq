## Regenerating the C bindings

The C low-level, unsafe C binding is provided by the `zmq-sys` crate,
also hosted in this repository. The bindings are only partially
auto-generated, to allow getting some platform-specific details
right.

The autogenerated part produced by the `bindgen` crate is stored in
the [`ffi.rs`] file inside the `zmq-sys` crate, and is created using
the `zmq.h` header file. First remove sigset, then using the following command:

```sh
BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS='-DZMQ_BUILD_DRAFT_API' bindgen --verbose --with-derive-default --allowlist-function "^zmq_.*" --allowlist-type "^zmq_.*" --allowlist-var "^ZMQ_.*" include/zmq.h -o ffi.rs
```

[`ffi.rs`]: ./zmq-sys/src/ffi.rs
